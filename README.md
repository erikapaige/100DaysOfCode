# 100DaysOfCode

## Description
Beginning today (August 10) I am embarking on the #100DaysofCode challenge. As a recent graduate of University Of Irvine's Web Development boot camp; I am using my free time to push myself to continue learning and exploring the world of coding.

I will start the challenge by reviewing what I learned in boot camp to further solidify my foundation in HTML, CSS, Javascript, databases and React. Following that, I will educate myself on platforms relevant to the fashion industry (like Shopify, Amazon, Google Analytics, SEO, and Squarespace, to name a few).Â 

For daily briefings please follow me on twitter (@erikapaigestyle), as the challenge requests that participants tweet their progress everyday. My projects and code will be pushed up daily to my GitHub, so that anyone can view my progress.
